# Review time

November 30, 2025

I don't really know Rust, and I don't really remember basic computer science that well, so maybe I can try to learn basic data structures and algorithms here.

I have my old C++ book, "Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C++" by Mark Allen Weiss. I can try working through that and translating it into Rust.

## Repository structure

Probably doesn't make sense to put everything in one crate, since it will compile super slowly. I'm not totally sure what structure I will want to use here, but I don't want to be too rigidly tied to only using the Weiss book and I don't want to be rigidly tied to a chapter / section based organization. I'd rather have a relatively flat project structure where I can go into a subdirectory and build and run individual projects.

## Setup

Dr. GPT has told me that `pre-commit` is actually used in Rust-only projects and so on since it's language-agnostic. I countered that I don't want to have to somehow wrangle the Python dependencies and a virtual environment in my Rust repository. GPT said most developers would just use their global pre-commit installation and document the use of this tool. So I ran `brew install pre-commit`. The point of this is to run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy`.
